It is used for recording real-time metrics in a time-series database, 
allowing for powerful queries and analysis, as well as alerting based on those metrics.

2. Explain the architecture of Prometheus.

Prometheus follows a server-agent model.

3. What is time-series data and how does Prometheus use it?
Ans:
it means it will collect the data time to time. prometheus uses timme series data to collect the metrices of the target 
machine for monitering and  better visualiztion.

4. How does Prometheus collect metrics from targets?
it uses pulling procces or we can se scraping to collect the metrices fromm the target for that 
we need node exporter in target machine

5 What is the role of exporters in Prometheus?
exporters are used to collect the metrices such as cpu usage memory usage disk from the hosts where it is running and 
expose these metrices in formate that prometheus can scrape and store 

6 Describe the PromQL language and its key features.
prometheus quary langauage it is quary langauage used to retreive manipulate and visualize the time series data stored
in its database 

7. What are the different types of metrics in Prometheus?
Ans:
Prometheus metrics can be classified into four types: counters, gauges, histograms, and summaries.
