Basic Jenkins Interview Questions
What is Jenkins?

Jenkins is an open-source tool used for automating tasks in software development, particularly for continuous integration (CI). It helps automate building, testing, and deploying software.

What is Jenkins used for?
Jenkins is used to automate the integration of code changes, allowing continuous testing, building, and deployment of applications.

How to add a user in Jenkins?
Go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Create User", fill in the details, and click "Create User".What is Jenkins Pipeline?
Jenkins Pipeline is a series of automated steps for continuous delivery, like building, testing, and deploying code in a sequence.

What is Jenkinsfile?
A Jenkinsfile is a text file that defines a Jenkins Pipeline's steps and is stored in the version control system.

What is continuous integration in Jenkins?
Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of frequently integrating code into a shared repository and automatically testing it to catch issues early.

What are the software prerequisites for installing Jenkins?
You need Java Development Kit (JDK) installed, and optionally a web server like Tomcat or WebSphere.

How to take a backup of your Jenkins build jobs?
Backup the Jenkins_Home directory, which includes configurations and job data. You can also use version control like Git for extra security.

State some of the advantages of using Jenkins.

Which commands can be used to begin Jenkins?
Run java -jar jenkins.war (foreground) or service start jenkins (as a service).

What is a CI/CD pipeline?
It’s an automated process for building, testing, and deploying code changes to ensure high-quality software delivery.


Intermediate Jenkins Interview Questions


Which architecture is recommended for a scalable Jenkins environment?
A distributed architecture where Jenkins agents handle builds, and the master coordinates everything.

How to change the port for Jenkins?

How to configure and use third-party tools in Jenkins?
Install the tool’s plugin, configure it under "Manage Jenkins", and use it in Jenkins jobs.

How to set up a Jenkins job?
Go to "New Item", choose a project type (e.g., Freestyle project), and configure SCM, build scripts, and triggers.

What are the steps included in a Jenkins pipeline?
Steps: Build → Test → Deploy.

What is the process for creating a backup and copying files in Jenkins?
Backup the Jenkins_Home directory. Copy job folders to back them up.

How will you create Pipeline in Jenkins?
Create a new item, select "Pipeline", add Jenkinsfile code, and save.

How to configure Docker in Jenkins?
Install Docker plugin, configure Docker settings in "Manage Jenkins", and use Docker commands in pipeline scripts.

When can you use the GitHub plugin in Jenkins?
Use it to link Jenkins with GitHub, trigger builds on commits, and automate the CI process.

Name two ways a Jenkins node agent can be configured to communicate back with the Jenkins master.

Advanced Jenkins Interview Questions


What is the process for securing Jenkins?
Configure global security, use authentication plugins, set role-based access control, and conduct security audits.

What is Groovy in Jenkins?
Groovy is a scripting language used in Jenkins for defining pipelines and jobs.

Explain a backup plugin and its uses.
Plugins like Jenkins Backup store job configurations and data, allowing for easy restoration after server failure.

What is a Ping Thread in Jenkins and how it works?
The Ping Thread checks if Jenkins nodes are alive by periodically pinging them. If a node is unresponsive, it's marked offline.
