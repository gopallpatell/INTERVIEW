1. What is Terraform?
Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp that allows
users to define and provision data center infrastructure using a high-level configuration language
called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) or JSON.
Example:
provider "aws" {
region = "us-west-2"
}
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
ami = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

2. What are the main features of Terraform?
Terraform's main features include Infrastructure as Code (IaC), execution plans, resource graphs,
change automation, and state management.
Example:
terraform {
backend "s3" {
bucket = "my-terraform-state"
key = "global/s3/terraform.tfstate"
region = "us-west-2"
}


3. What is the difference between Terraform and other IaC tools like
Ansible, Puppet, and Chef?

Terraform focuses on infrastructure provisioning, is declarative, and uses HCL. Tools like Ansible,
Puppet, and Chef focus on configuration management and are procedural.
Example:
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
ami = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

4. What is a provider in Terraform?
A provider is a plugin, Providers define the resources and data sources available.
Example:
provider "aws" {
region = "us-west-2"
}

5. How does Terraform manage dependencies?
Terraform uses a dependency graph to manage dependencies 
means it will Automatically determine correct order for resource creation, update, or deletion.
Example:
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
ami = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
instance_type = "t2.micro"
subnet_id = aws_subnet.example.id
}
resource "aws_subnet" "example" {
vpc_id = aws_vpc.example.id
cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
}
resource "aws_vpc" "example" {
cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

6. What is a state file in Terraform?
it is used to store and track the current state of the infrastructure. 
Example:
terraform state show

7. Why is it important to manage the state file in Terraform?
it is immportant to manage the terraformm state file bcz it has all the history about the infrastructure and if we lost
the state file then we dont have longer history about the infrastructure like what changes we made what resouces are created 
what is the size of resource. to avoiding all this we need to keep the state file upto date and secure..

8. How can you secure the state file in Terraform?
Use remote backends (S3, Terraform Cloud, etc.) instead of local files.
Enable encryption for state files at rest and in transit.
Use state locking to avoid concurrent writes.
Restrict access to the state file using IAM policies or RBAC.
Enable versioning to keep track of changes and roll back if needed.
Use secrets management services to store sensitive information outside the state file.
Limit access to only trusted users or systems.
Back up your state file regularly.
Example:
terraform {
backend "s3" {
bucket = "my-terraform-state"
key = "global/s3/terraform.tfstate"
region = "us-west-2"
encrypt = true
}
}

9. What are modules in Terraform?
modules are used for reusable work

Modules are  used when we want to reuse anthing like i have created a ec2 instance and 
i want to reuse this infrastructure in future for that we create module of this infrastructure 

Example:
module "vpc" {
source = "./modules/vpc"
}

10. What is the purpose of the terraform init command
it is used to initialize the provider To Download Terraform Provider to Terraform Project

11. What does the terraform plan command do?
Preview the Terraform Script 
terraform plan creates an execution plan, 

12. What is the terraform apply command used for?
The terraform apply command is used to apply the terraform script or create and update the infrastructure 
the changes defined in your Terraform configuration to your actual infrastructure.

13. What is the purpose of the terraform destroy command?
terraform destroy is used to destroy the infrastructure managed by Terraform. It removes all
the resources defined in the configuration.
Example:
terraform destroy
