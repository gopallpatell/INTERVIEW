Docker (In One Line)
Docker is a tool that packages an application and all its dependencies into a lightweight, portable container that can run anywhere.

difference between -v and --mount
A Docker mount is used to attach storage from:
Host machine
Docker-managed volume
-v is the old shorthand syntax (less clear), e.g.:
   docker run -v /host/path:/container/path image
--mount is the newer, explicit, recommended syntax, e.g.:
   docker run --mount type=bind,source=/host/path,target=/container/path image

docker volume create app_data
docker run -d --mount source=/var/lib/docker/volumes/db_data,target=/var/lib/mysql mysql

Use LVM (Advanced / Production)
sudo mount /dev/vg_data/lv_data  /var/lib/docker/volumes/db_data

### monitering and logging 
Q what is the nohup 
  nohup is used to write the logs in file directly. it will run the command in the background and give the output in a file
  "nohup.out"
  command - nohup docker logs -f <containerID> &

we can also use ' docker stats ' to see the health and usage of the docker containers
CONTAINER ID   NAME        CPU %   MEM USAGE / LIMIT   MEM %   NET I/O       BLOCK I/O     PIDS
a1b2c3d4       web_app     35.2%   256MiB / 1GiB       25%     10MB / 8MB    1.2MB / 0B    15

nohup docker stats & 

Q what is ngnix 
  Nginx is a high-performance web server and reverse proxy used to efficiently serve and manage web traffic.

Client request भेजता है
Nginx config check करता है
अगर static file है → direct serve
अगर backend चाहिए → proxy_pass
अगर multiple backend हैं → load balance
Fast event-driven mechanism से हजारों requests handle करता है


### Project
web application (django) + ngnix (for reverse proxy) + MYsql(backend)

it is a django app and it is connect to mysql and it wwill be served by ngnix

first we need to create 3 containers
for that we need to write docker compose file 
vim docker-compose
version: "3.8"
  services:
    nginx:
      build:          ### or we can directly build the image using image: nginx    but wwe need to copy the file from host           
        context: ./nginx     to container thats why we create dockerfile in github in ./nginx direcory and build in compose.
      nginx_name: nginx
      ports:
        - "80:80"
      restart: always
      depends_on:
        - django
    mysql:
      container_name: mysql
      image: mysql
      ports:
        - "3306:3306"
      environment:
        MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
        MYSQL_DATABASE: mysql-db
      volumes: 
        - ./my-volume:/war/lib/mysql
      networks:
        - my-network
      restart: always
      healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "mysqladmin", "ping", "-h", "localhost", "-uroot", "-proot"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 60s
    django:
      build:
        context: .    # because the file is in open space not in a directory so . is for PWD
      conatainer_name: django        # conatainer name should be the same that we use in reverse proxy in nginx in  default.conf file "proxy_pass: http/django:8000;
      command: sh -c "python mannage.py migrate --no-input && gunicorn notesapp.wsgi --bind 0.0.0.0:8000"    # gunicorn is a tool that is used to serve the application in 
                                                                                    production and migrate means it will create tables and columbs and no input for not ask  
                                                                                    for yes or no input while creating tables an "sh -c" for shell commands.
      ports: 
        - "8000:8000"
      env_file:                      
        - ".env"      # in env file we give the DB_NAME: test_db,DB_PASSWORD: root,DB_USER: root,DB_PORT:3306,DB_HOST:mysql 
      networks:
        - my-networks 
      restart: always 
      depends_on:
        - mysql
      healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost:8000/admin || exit 1"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 30s
      
volumes: 
  my-volume
networks
  my-network


esc then :wq and enter

docker compose up 

and if we rewrite the compose file then we need to build this file for that we use "docker compose up --build"

errors 
if we didnt give the proper name of networks then both containers are not being connected if we mistack in given name then 
wwe will get the errors




Q.1 Tell me some about Hypervisor. 
  hypervisor is used to create the vms using hypervisor we can create multiple vms on a single physical server

Q.2 Can you state the advantages of Docker over Hypervisor?
  Virtual Machines :
		- VMs are hardware level Virtualization 
		- VMs are created using Hypervisor 
		- VMs are used to run the Operating Systems
		- VMs will continue to execute even if there is no task or active applications
		- VMs consume more space and time to start up.
  Containers :
		- Containers are application level Virtualization 
		- Containers are created using Container Engine 
		- Containers are used to run the the Application. NOT Operating Systems
		- Containers will immediately go to EXIT state, if there is no task or active applications
		- Containers consume less space and time to start up
		- Using Containers we can reduce the no. of VM, But we cannot completely elimate VMs
	- Container run in its own isolated address spac, the scope of the container application is within the container 
	
Q.3 Define Docker images.
  Is a Static file that defined the properties of the Container and its dependencies 

Q.4 what is the current docker version
    27.5.1

Q.5 Tell me something about Docker machine. 
  Docker Machine is a tool that helps you create and manage Docker environments 
  A Docker environment is the collection of everything that allows you to run Docker containers, including the Docker 
  Engine, host machine, containers, images, 
 Here’s a breakdown of the key elements that make up a Docker environment:

  Docker Engine:
  This is the core software that runs Docker containers.

  Docker Host:
  The Docker host is the physical or virtual machine where the Docker Engine runs. It provides the resources (like CPU, 
  memory, and storage) needed to run containers.

  Containers:
  Containers are lightweight, isolated environments where applications run. 

Docker Images:
Is a Static file that defined the properties of the Container and its dependencies

Docker Registry (e.g., Docker Hub):
docker regestry is place where we can shave the docker images and version controle

Q.6 Define Docker Swarms.
  - Used to Ensure High Availability of Containers by creating Replicas of Containers.
  It is meant only for Docker Containers.

Q.7 then why we use kubernetes instant of docker swarn..?
   If your app is small, Docker Swarm might be enough. But if you want to run large, complex apps that need advanced 
   features, Kubernetes is the better choice.

  Kubernetes has a much richer set of features. It includes powerful tools like:
  Automated rollbacks and updates
  Self-healing (restarting containers that fail)
  Horizontal scaling
  Customizable resource management (CPU, memory)
  Stateful sets (for managing stateful applications like databases)
  Complex networking configurations

Q.8  Describe the usage of Dockerfile?
  A Dockerfile is a text file it is a set of instructions for building a Docker image.

FROM: Defines the base image for the container.
RUN: Executes commands to set up the environment.
CMD: CMD defines the default command to run when the container starts.
COPY: Copies files from the host to the container.
ADD: Similar to COPY, with additional features like fetching remote files.
WORKDIR: Sets the working directory inside the container.
EXPOSE: Specifies which ports the container will use.
VOLUME: Creates mount points for persistent storage.
ENV: Sets environment variables.
ARG: Defines build-time variables.
USER: Specifies the user to run the container as.
SHELL: Specifies the shell to use for RUN commands.

Q.9 What is command to build  docker image from Dockerfile ?
  $ docker build -t image_name .    # .  is for build the imagre in current directory

Q.10  What is the command to run the image as a container?
  $ docker run -it image_name

Q. 11  What is difference between ADD and COPY in Dockerfile
 COPY 								# To Copy the file from host volume to container volume
 ADD 								# To Copy the file from Host Volume as well as from URL

Q.12  what are Docker Namespaces?
    it is used to create a isolated invironment 
Without namespaces:
All containers would see the same processes, same network interfaces, same filesystem.
If you ran ps aux inside one container, you could see every process on the host.
If you created files in /, they would affect the host filesystem.

🔹 2️⃣ Namespaces are what enforce isolation
What happens because of namespaces	Example
PID namespace → isolates processes	ps aux in container sees only container processes
   docker run -it --name pid-test ubuntu bash         ps aux | pgrep pid-test        # shows container’s process but container itself cannot see host processes.
NET namespace → isolates networking	Container has its own IP & ports; cannot see host or other container IPs
   docker run -it --name net-test ubuntu bash         ip addr
MNT namespace → isolates filesystem	Container has its own root /; cannot touch host files
   docker run -it --name mnt-test ubuntu bash
UTS namespace → isolates hostname	Container thinks it has its own hostname
   docker run -it --name uts-test --hostname mycontainer ubuntu bash
IPC namespace → isolates shared memory	Container cannot access shared memory of host/other containers
USER namespace → isolates users	root in container ≠ root on host
   

Q. 13 Why is it necessary to monitor a  Docker?
 Monitoring ensures containers run reliably, securely, and efficiently.
  Resource usage: Track CPU, memory, disk to prevent overload.
  Container health: Detect crashes or freezes via healthchecks.
  Logs: Debug apps and audit activity.
  Network: Ensure proper communication between containers.
  Security: Detect anomalies or attacks.
  Performance & scaling: Optimize resources and scale efficiently.  

Q. 14  Define Docker compose?
  Docker Compose is a tool that helps you run and manage multiple Docker containers at the same time, with just one command.

Q. 15  What is depends_on in Docker compose
  it is used when one server is depends on the another server. like if i am using a web server and one db server and i want 
  to start db server first then i can use depend on after the 
  web server like this 

version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    depends_on:
      - db
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example


like a web app needing a database to be available first.


Q. 16  Describe the role of Docker load and save command.
  it is use to import and export the docker images without internet. 
  using "docker save -o file.tar  gopallpatell/netflix:v1.0"   we compress the image in a file for exporting the image 
  and using "docker load -i file.tar" to extract that file offline 

  docker save: Creates a tarball of a Docker image that you can transfer or back up.
  docker load: Loads a Docker image from a tarball into your local Docker environment.

Q. 17 Which is the most feasible type of application for Docker containers – Stateless or Stateful?
  Stateless applications are generally more feasible and suited for Docker containers compared to stateful 
  applications. 
  bcz dont need to give any input for this type of application.
                  Stateless Applications
				- Application that will not have any state of execution
				- Applications that will not create any output/need any input.
		  Stateful Applications ::
				- Application that will have state of execution
				- Applications that requires some input and generate some output

Q 18.  Differentiate between a Docker layer and a image.
  Layers are the individual steps to create and building the image 
  docker Image is the final, complete result that you can use to create something (like a container in Docker).

Q.19 vertualization
  Virtualization allows multiple virtual computers (VMs) to run on a single physical machine, improving efficiency and 
  flexibility.
  Hypervisor:
  The hypervisor is the software that manages and runs virtual machines. 
  It sits between the physical hardware and the VMs, allocating resources like CPU, memory, and storage to each VM.
  a hypervisor is the software that allows multiple virtual computers to run on a single physical machine.
 
Q.20  What if you have accidentally out of the Docker containers, will you loose the files?
  If you have a container running a web application and the database is storing data in a Docker volume or a bind mount, 
  even if the container crashes or is removed, the database files will still be available in the volume or on the host 
  system.

  Conclusion:
  Without volumes or mounts: Yes, you will lose the files inside the container.
  With volumes or mounts: No, your files are safe and persistent even if you remove the container.


Q.21   What are factors that decides the number of containers you can run on?
  System resources like CPU, RAM, and disk space are the main limiting factors.

Q.22 What is Dockerfile Instructions ?
  Dockerfile contains a set of Instructions to build Docker Image

Q23  What is Docker Prune ?
  docker prune ins used to delete the unused container, images and volumes 

  Here are the docker prune commands in one line:
  docker system prune: Removes stopped containers, unused networks, dangling images, and build cache.
  docker container prune: Removes stopped containers.
  docker image prune: Removes dangling images (images not tagged or used by any container).
  docker volume prune: Removes unused Docker volumes.
  docker network prune: Removes unused Docker networks.


Q24 why docker is important for devops.?
  Docker is important for DevOps because it simplifies and streamlines the development, testing, and deployment process. 
  Here’s why:
  lie for isolation and scalability we can run multiple container on a single vm 

Q25   Please Explain How Does Docker Work?
  First, you build a Docker image using a Dockerfile or pull an image from a registry (like Docker Hub).
  Then, you run a container from the image, and Docker takes care of setting up the environment for your application to run.
  The container is isolated but can communicate with other containers or the host system as needed, using features like 
   networking and volumes.

Q26  What is the difference between containerization and virtualization?
  Virtualization allows multiple virtual computers (VMs) to run on a single physical machine, improving efficiency and 
  flexibility.
  containerization is the process of packaging the application and its dependences.
  it can be also used to run multiple application in one VM


Q27 How do you keep your Docker images up to date?
  Using a continuous integration (CI) pipeline: A CI pipeline can automatically build and test Docker images.
  or we can version controle the image 

Q29   You want to update a running container with a new version of the application without downtime. How can you achieve 
   zero-downtime deployments in Docker?
  1. Rolling update: Docker Swarm will update one container at a time, 
  2. Blue-Green Deployment (Manual Method)
  In more advanced scenarios, you can implement a blue-green deployment strategy manually, where you run two identical 
  environments (blue and green), switching traffic between them.
Rolling Update: Slowly replace old parts of a machine while it’s running.
Blue-Green: Build a new machine completely, then switch to it instantly.

30. docker commit 
  docker commit is used to create new image based on the modified continers or we can say existing containers
  docker commit <container_id> my_ubuntu_with_vim:latest

31 Port Mapping / Port Binding ::::
  - It is used to expose the container to access thru internet 
  docker run -it -p <host_Port>:<container_Port> tomcat:8.0
  docker run -it -p 8089:8080 tomcat:8.0

32 docker mount 
  docker run --mount source=my_data,target=/data my_image

  docker run -v /host/path:/container/path my_image
  /host/path: The full path to the directory or file on your host machine.
  /container/path: The path inside the container where the file or directory will be mounted.

33. How can you link multiple Docker containers together?
  Docker provides a feature called container networking, which allows you to link multiple containers together.
   or we can use docker compose 
docker run -d --name my-container --network my-network nginx

34 How do you optimize a Docker image to reduce its size?
  Combine commands (RUN, COPY, ADD) to reduce layers.
  Remove unnecessary files (e.g., temp files, package manager cache).
  Use multi-stage builds to separate build dependencies from runtime dependencies.
  remove unneccessory layers

35. What is the difference between ENTRYPOINT and CMD in Docker?
 ENTRYPOINT: Defines the main command that should always run when the container starts. It is usually the primary process.
 CMD: Defines the default arguments for the command (or the command itself if ENTRYPOINT is not set). It's the fallback if 
 no command is provided when the container starts..
  entrypoint is a main command and cmd is defualt commmand if entrypoint command is not define then cmd will execute.

36 How do you troubleshoot a failed container in Docker?
  first we will check docker logs then we inspect the container we run in the interactive mode we need to check the port 
  mapping  then rebuild the image all this things to troubleshoot

37 cmd command if I run multiple time then what happen
  If you run the CMD command multiple times in a Dockerfile, only the last CMD instruction will be used when the container 
  starts. Docker will ignore any previous CMD instructions that appear before it.

38. I have application and application database also, how to deploy this both in one using docker
  we use docker compose and we add depends_on 

39. I am trying to pull image using image name  that image not getting accessible through docker hub repo , so what is the 
    problem
  Incorrect Image Name or Tag: Ensure the image name and tag are correct. Example: docker pull ubuntu:latest.
  Private Repository: If the image is private, you need to log in to Docker Hub using docker login.
  Image Not Pushed: The image might not be uploaded to Docker Hub. Verify if it's available on the Docker Hub repository.
  Tag Doesn't Exist: The tag you're trying to pull might not exist. Check the available tags on Docke

40. what issue you face while creating container like it created and stopped what the issue
   it happen if entrypoint is wrong 
   insuffeciant memory or cpu
   Port already in use == Container fails to bind to port

41 what is multi stage in dockerfile
   Multi-stage builds in Docker allow you to use multiple FROM statements in a single Dockerfile to optimize the build 
   process, reduce image size, and separate the build environment from the runtime environment.

42. how to bind the volumes to container
   docker run -v <host_path>:<container_path> <image_name>

43. what is difference between cmd and env in dockerfile what will happen we use both of them in dockerfile
  cmd is for default commnd and env is for invironment variable it is used for sensitive data and api keys
  we can use both cmd is for default execution and env for passing env variable
