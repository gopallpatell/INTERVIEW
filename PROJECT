my project is about banking and finance 
the requierement of this project is it is monolith architecture based application and need to convert in microservice based
architectre 

object of this is to ensure high vailibility and scalibilty of the application 

i have devided my projects in 3 phases 
1st is to provitioning the infrastructure i have used terraform to create the infrastructure from local machine
i have created one master of mmaster server one server if for jenkins slave one is for test one is for prod and one is for 
monitering 

then the second phase is for server configuration and do automation of the builds and deployments
i have configured all the required tools in the servers then wwrite the jenkins pipeline for builds and deployments 
we have diff stages in the pipeline first stage is used to version controle the source code for this i used github 
then in second step i have used maven plugin to compile the code and create the artifacts for that i have used 
maven clean package this command will clean the old files and create the artifacts then in third stage i have build a
dockker image based on dockerfile and then pushed to docker repository for version controle it then in fourth 
stage i have create the container using that image and in fifth stage deploy that container to the test server using 
ansible 
then i have created next step to deploy that containers to production server using kubernetes for ensure high
availability of the containers and create the replicas 
and enable webhook to trigger the pipeline if any changes is happened in the source code.

then the third phase is for monitering where i have configured node exporter in the master of master node and in the
production server to collect the matrices such as cpu utilization memory utilization and send that in a formate that 
prometheus can scrape and store then using grafana i have created the deshbords for visualization.
