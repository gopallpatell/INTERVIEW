
1 diff between authorization and authentication.

       Authentication:

       Purpose: Verifies who the user is.
       means the person who is looking for the access, he needs authentication using username password and other things.
  
       Authorization:

       Purpose: Determines what the user is allowed to do.
       means who gives the access or allowed to do anything.


2 what is IAM..?

      IAM (Identity and Access Management)

3. Instance type in AWS.

      In AWS, an instance type defines the hardware specifications (such as CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity) 
      of a virtual server (called an EC2 instance) that you can launch in the cloud.
  
      Choosing the right instance type depends on:

      Workload: Whether it's CPU, memory, or storage-intensive.
      Cost: Some instance types are more expensive based on their specifications.
      Performance: Choose an instance that matches your performance requirements for a given application.

stack in cloudformation 

   A CloudFormation Stack is essentially a collection of AWS resources
   
   if you have a CloudFormation template that defines an EC2 instance, an S3 bucket, and a security group, these resources will be grouped into a stack. 
   If you need to make changes to the resources (e.g., update an EC2 instance type or add a new S3 bucket), you can modify the template and update the entire stack.

 Resources:
  MyEC2Instance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      InstanceType: t2.micro
      ImageId: ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0
