1 what is identifire in python 
In Python, an identifier is a name used to identify variables, functions, classes, modules

2 Type Conversion
Type conversion in Python refers to the process of converting one data type to another.
a = 5        # Integer
b = 3.2      # Float
result = a + b   # Python automatically converts 'a' (int) to float before performing addition
print(result)    # Output: 8.2


3 type casting
Type Casting allows for converting data types manually in Python 

# Converting float to int
num = 10.75
int_num = int(num)  # Converts 10.75 to 10
print(int_num)      # Output: 10

# Converting string to int
str_num = "25"
int_str = int(str_num)  # Converts "25" to 25
print(int_str)      # Output: 25


4 concatination

it means it will add two strings in one entity

str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "World"
result = str1 + " " + str2  # Concatenates with a space in between
print(result)  # Output: "Hello World"


5. What is the difference between a Mutable datatype and an Immutable data type?
Mutable data types can be edited i.e., they can change at runtime. Eg – List, Dictionary, etc.
Immutable data types can not be edited i.e., they can not change at runtime. Eg – String, Tuple, etc.


What is Indexing?
it use to find the items in a list or words

What is Slicing?
Slicing is like cutting a portion from a list, string, or other sequence in Python. 

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
print(nums[3:6])  # Output: [4, 5, 6]

What is Scope in Python?
The location where we can find a variable and also access it if required is called the scope of a variable.
