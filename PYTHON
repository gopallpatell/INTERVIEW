1 what is identifire in python 
In Python, an identifier is a name used to identify variables, functions, classes, modules

2 Type Conversion
Type conversion in Python refers to the process of converting one data type to another.
a = 5        # Integer
b = 3.2      # Float
result = a + b   # Python automatically converts 'a' (int) to float before performing addition
print(result)    # Output: 8.2


3 type casting
Type Casting allows for converting data types manually in Python 

# Converting float to int
num = 10.75
int_num = int(num)  # Converts 10.75 to 10
print(int_num)      # Output: 10

# Converting string to int
str_num = "25"
int_str = int(str_num)  # Converts "25" to 25
print(int_str)      # Output: 25


4 concatination

it means it will add two strings in one entity

str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "World"
result = str1 + " " + str2  # Concatenates with a space in between
print(result)  # Output: "Hello World"


5. What is the difference between a Mutable datatype and an Immutable data type?
Mutable data types can be edited i.e., they can change at runtime. Eg – List, Dictionary, etc.
Immutable data types can not be edited i.e., they can not change at runtime. Eg – String, Tuple, etc.


What is Indexing?
it use to find the items in a list or words

What is Slicing?
Slicing is like cutting a portion from a list, string, or other sequence in Python. 

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
print(nums[3:6])  # Output: [4, 5, 6]

What is Scope in Python?
The location where we can find a variable and also access it if required is called the scope of a variable.

Q indentation 
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.
Example
if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!") 
if 5 > 2:
        print("Five is greater than two!") 

Comments can be used to explain Python code.  
Variables are used to store the value

__init__ Method: It's specifically used for initializing objects in a class. 

Class: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of the objects.

objects= an object is a specific instance of a class. It is a collection of data and functions 

function are used for reusability and for simplification of code 
like we have def function lambda function 

Function: A function is used for reusability  that is used performs a specific task. 
It takes inputs (parameters), performs some operation, and often returns a result. Functions can be defined independently 
or inside classes (methods).


a sequence is a ordered collection of items,

Lists (Mutable)
Tuples (Immutable)
Strings (Immutable)
Ranges (Immutable)

Indexing: Access elements using an index (sequence[index]).
Slicing: Access a subrange of elements (sequence[start:end]).
Concatenation: Combine sequences using the + operator (sequence1 + sequence2)
Length: Get the length of a sequence using len(sequence).


"r" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist

"a" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist

"w" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist

"x" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists


a module is a file that contains Python code, 


Flask: Lightweight micro based framework, flexible, and easy to get started with. 
Suitable for small to medium-sized applications or APIs where you need more control.
