✅  difference between ReplicaSet, Deployment, and StatefulSet and daemonSet in Kubernetes 👇

 1️⃣ ReplicaSet (RS)
Ensures a specific number of identical pods are always running.
✔ Auto-restart
✔ Auto-scale
❌ No rolling updates
❌ No version control
❌ No stable network identity
👉 Used inside Deployment automatically.
👉 You rarely create ReplicaSet directly.

✅ 2️⃣ Deployment
Manages ReplicaSets + provides rolling updates and rollbacks.
✔ Rolling updates
✔ Rollbacks
✔ Version control
✔ Easy to scale
❌ No unique identity
❌ Not for database-type workloads
👉 Best for stateless applications like:
Nginx
Node.js
Python
Java apps
APIs

✅ 3️⃣ StatefulSet
Used for stateful applications where each pod needs a fixed identity.
✔ Stable pod name (pod-0, pod-1...)
✔ Stable network identity
✔ Stable storage (PVC per pod)
✔ Ordered startup & shutdown
❌ Slower scaling
❌ Not needed for stateless apps
👉 Used for databases:
MySQL
MongoDB

✅ DaemonSet 
DaemonSet ensures that exactly one pod runs on every node (or on selected nodes).

✅  what is jobs in kubernetes
    job is used in k8s to Runs a pod until the task finishes              (written in .yml repo)
2️⃣ Retry Job
A job that runs a command which fails, and Kubernetes retries it 4 times until it succeeds or reaches limit.
3️⃣ Multi-Run Job
A job that runs the same task 3 times, one after another, until all are completed successfully.
4️⃣ Parallel Job
A job that runs 5 tasks, but only 2 pods run at the same time (parallel batch processing).
5️⃣ Database Backup Job
A job that starts a container once, runs a mysqldump command, saves the database backup, and then exits.

wwhy we need PV and PVC 
wwhen a pod is crached or deleted the data wwill gone But your data should NOT be deleted when pods are deleted.
So Kubernetes needs a separate storage system that lives independently of pods.

✅ PV and PVC 
✅ PV =  A PersistentVolume (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster
Policy	
Retain	Keep data even after PVC deleted
Delete	Delete underlying storage when PVC deleted

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-demo
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  hostPath:
    path: /mnt/data   # local storage path on node (for demo)

✅ PVC = A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a request for storage by a pod.   ( means firstly wwe need to create the PV and then we need to claim that PV it is called PVC )
 Admin creates PV (cluster storage available)
User creates PVC (pod asks for storage)
Kubernetes matches PVC to a PV
Pod uses PVC to mount storage
Data persists even if pod dies or is recreated

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pvc-demo
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi

✅ How pods/deployments use PVC 
apiVersion: v1

  containers:
  - name: app
    image: busybox
    command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Hello > /data/hello.txt && sleep 3600"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: storage
      mountPath: /data
  volumes:
  - name: storage
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: pvc-demo


✅ after all this if we go to the path /mnt/data in node where the pod is running ( assume this pod is running on workernode1 that is a container ) 
   so we go inside that container and we can see the data in /mnt/data

4 What are clusters in Kubernetes?
  A Kubernetes cluster is a collection of nodes (machines) that work together, with the control plane managing and 
  coordinating the worker nodes. 
  The cluster is responsible for running and managing applications in containers, 
  ensuring high availability, scalability, and reliability.

👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉�

6 What is a node in Kubernetes?
   A node in Kubernetes is a machine (physical or virtual) that runs containerized applications. 
  There are two types of nodes: Master nodes that manage the cluster, and Worker nodes that run the applications.

👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉�
7 List the main components of Kubernetes architecture.
 The Kubernetes architecture consists of two main parts:
  Control Plane: Manages the cluster and makes global decisions (API Server, Scheduler, Controller Manager, etcd).
  Node (Worker Node): Runs containers and workloads (Kubelet, Container Runtime, Kube Proxy, Pods).

            API_Server 				--> # Acts as an interface to the kubernetes or we can say it is the brain + entry gate of the Kubernetes cluster.
            ETCD 				--> # Single point of Source for Kubernetes Components or we can say it is a data source for the cluster
	        Controller Manager 	         	--> # To run the pods in its desired state 
            Scheduler				--> # To identify the Healthy Node for Deployments
	        Kubelet 				--> # Is a Kubernetes Agent used to Create & Deploy the Pods	
	        CRI - Container RunTime Interface (Container-D) --> # It is used identify the Image from Container Registry for deployment
            KubeProxy				--> # it enable communication between pods and services, inside and outside the cluster.
                                             Pod IPs are assigned by the CNI plugin (like Flannel, Calico, Weave)
You run: kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml
kubectl sends request → API Server
API Server validates YAML
Saves state in etcd
Scheduler gets notified
Scheduler selects a node
Kubelet on that node creates the pod

API Server stores state → Controller Manager checks → Scheduler assigns → Kubelet runs → Kube-Proxy connects → Repeat forever.

8 List the different types of services in Kubernetes.
  ClusterIP: The ClusterIP service is used to expose a service only within the Kubernetes cluster, not to the outside world.
             Backend Pod needs to talk to Database Pod
             Frontend Pod needs to talk to Backend Pod
             Microservices communicate internally
  NodePort: Exposes your service outside the cluster by opening a port on every node.
            For testing
            When you don’t have a cloud LoadBalancer
            Small environments or labs
            Not good for production because:
               Port range is limited (30000–32767)
               No automatic load balancing
               Must enter IP + NodePort manually
  LoadBalancer: Provisions an external load balancer, exposing the service to the internet.
             You want public access
             Want automatic load balancing across nodes
            Not ideal when: 
            You create many services → each gets a public IP (costly)
            You want routing on paths/domains → not supported
  ExternalName: it is used to connect with external resource like database API
Ingress (Domain + routing + rules)
📌 What it does:
Ingress gives:
Domain name support
URL path routing
TLS/HTTPS
Single public IP for many services

9 What is Ingress network?
  ingress is a traffic controler in lkubernetes which is used to send the traffic or route the traffice to the right service in kubernetes cluster
  Ingress helps direct incoming internet traffic to the right service inside the cluster. For example, if someone visits example.com/api, 
  Ingress will send that request to your "API" service, and if they visit example.com/blog, Ingress will send it to the "Blog" service

  Single Entry Point:
  Instead of creating a separate entry for each service (like exposing each one with its own IP address), 
  you can use Ingress to create one entry point (one IP or domain) that handles traffic for all your services. This simplifies the setup.
  Ingress is like a traffic controller that makes sure the right visitors (users) get directed to the right service in your Kubernetes cluster.
  It helps you manage access through one main entry point (a single IP or domain).
  It can handle things like routing, load balancing, and security (SSL encryption).

12 deployment 
  in this we have extra features like rollback and rolling update 
  Deployment in Kubernetes is a higher-level resource that manages the deployment and lifecycle of your application’s pods. 
  It allows you to define the desired state of your application, such as the number of replicas, 
  the version of the application, and how updates should be rolled out. Kubernetes then takes care of ensuring that the current state matches the desired state.
				
  Automatically running a specified number of copies (pods) of your app.
  Ensuring that the right version of the app is always running.
  Allowing you to easily update the app and automatically handle any failures or rollbacks.

15 What do you know about clusters of containers in Kubernetes? 
  A Kubernetes Cluster consists of a control plane (master) and multiple worker nodes.
  Each node runs a container runtime (e.g., Docker, containerd) that runs Pods.
  Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, and they can contain one or more containers.
  Kubernetes clusters provide features like scaling, self-healing, and load balancing for containerized applications, making them ideal for running large-scale distributed systems.

30 How do you set resource limits on Kubernetes Pods?
   we can limit flag in yaml file to limit the resource on pods  like cpu and memory usage 
   or we can also request for memory and cpu 

  Memory Limits: If a container exceeds its memory limit, it will be terminated and potentially restarted by Kubernetes.
  This is called an OOM (Out of Memory) Kill.
  CPU Limits: When a container exceeds its CPU limit, it will be throttled (i.e., Kubernetes will restrict the container's 
  CPU usage but will not kill it).

37. its ok if I had 2 container in one pod , what you will suggest
   it’s okay to have two containers in one Pod, especially when they need to work together closely 
   However, always evaluate if they really need to be in the same Pod, as separating them can improve flexibility 
   and scalability.
   Can reduce scalability because both containers scale together. If one container needs more resources or scaling,
   both containers will scale together.
