✅  difference between ReplicaSet, Deployment, and StatefulSet and daemonSet in Kubernetes 👇

 1️⃣ ReplicaSet (RS)                                                  # it is used in stateless application
Ensures a specific number of identical pods are always running.
✔ Auto-restart
✔ Auto-scale
❌ No rolling updates
❌ No version control
❌ No stable network identity
👉 Used inside Deployment automatically.
👉 You rarely create ReplicaSet directly.

✅ 2️⃣ Deployment                                                         # it is used in stateless application
Manages ReplicaSets + provides rolling updates and rollbacks.
 in this we have extra features like rollback and rolling update 
  Deployment in Kubernetes is a higher-level resource that manages the deployment and lifecycle of your application’s pods. 
  It allows you to define the desired state of your application, such as the number of replicas, 
  the version of the application, and how updates should be rolled out. Kubernetes then takes care of ensuring that the current state matches the desired state.
				
  Automatically running a specified number of copies (pods) of your app.
  Ensuring that the right version of the app is always running.
  Allowing you to easily update the app and automatically handle any failures or rollbacks.
✔ Rolling updates
✔ Rollbacks
✔ Version control
✔ Easy to scale
❌ No unique identity
❌ Not for database-type workloads
👉 Best for stateless applications like:
Nginx
Node.js
Python
Java apps
APIs

✅ 3️⃣ StatefulSet
Used for stateful applications where each pod needs a fixed identity.
✔ Stable pod name (pod-0, pod-1...)     # If a Pod crashes or is deleted, Kubernetes recreates it with the same name.
✔ Stable network identity
✔ Stable storage (PVC per pod)
✔ Ordered startup & shutdown
❌ Slower scaling
❌ Not needed for stateless apps
👉 Used for databases:
MySQL
MongoDB

🔐 What is a Secret?
A Secret stores sensitive data such as:
Passwords
Tokens
Keys
Why use it?
Avoid hardcoding passwords in YAML
Better security
Can be rotated without changing app code
👉 Examples:
MySQL root password
DB user password

2️⃣ Create Secret (MySQL passwords)
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootpassword
  MYSQL_PASSWORD: apppassword

⚙️ What is a ConfigMap?
A ConfigMap stores non-sensitive configuration such as:
App settings
DB names
Environment values
Config files
👉 Examples:
Database name
MySQL user
Application config values

1️⃣ Create ConfigMap (MySQL configuration)
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: mysql-config
data:
  MYSQL_DATABASE: appdb
  MYSQL_USER: appuser


3️⃣ Updated StatefulSet using ConfigMap + Secret
❌ Before (BAD – hardcoded)
env:
- name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
  value: rootpassword

✅ After (GOOD – secure + clean)
envFrom:
- configMapRef:
    name: mysql-config
- secretRef:
    name: mysql-secret

4️⃣ Full StatefulSet (only env section changed)
containers:
- name: mysql
  image: mysql:8.0
  ports:
  - containerPort: 3306
    name: mysql
  envFrom:
  - configMapRef:
      name: mysql-config
  - secretRef:
      name: mysql-secret
  volumeMounts:
  - name: mysql-data
    mountPath: /var/lib/mysql




✅ One-line summary

ConfigMap stores configuration, Secret stores credentials, and both are injected into pods as environment variables for 
secure, maintainable Kubernetes deployments.

    job is used in k8s to Runs a pod until the task finishes              (written in .yml repo)
2️⃣ Retry Job
A job that runs a command which fails, and Kubernetes retries it 4 times until it succeeds or reaches limit.
3️⃣ Multi-Run Job
A job that runs the same task 3 times, one after another, until all are completed successfully.
4️⃣ Parallel Job
A job that runs 5 tasks, but only 2 pods run at the same time (parallel batch processing).
5️⃣ Database Backup Job
A job that starts a container once, runs a mysqldump command, saves the database backup, and then exits.

wwhy we need PV and PVC 
wwhen a pod is crached or deleted the data wwill gone But your data should NOT be deleted when pods are deleted.
So Kubernetes needs a separate storage system that lives independently of pods.

✅ PV and PVC 
✅ PV =  A PersistentVolume (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster
Policy	
Retain	Keep data even after PVC deleted
Delete	Delete underlying storage when PVC deleted

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-demo
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  hostPath:
    path: /mnt/data   # local storage path on node (for demo)

✅ PVC = A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a request for storage by a pod.   ( means firstly wwe need to create the PV and then we need to claim that PV it is called PVC )
 Admin creates PV (cluster storage available)
User creates PVC (pod asks for storage)
Kubernetes matches PVC to a PV
Pod uses PVC to mount storage
Data persists even if pod dies or is recreated

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pvc-demo
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi

✅ How pods/deployments use PVC 
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-using-pvc
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: busybox
    command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Hello > /data/hello.txt && sleep 3600"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: storage
      mountPath: /data
  volumes:
  - name: storage
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: pvc-demo


✅ after all this if we go to the path /mnt/data in node where the pod is running ( assume this pod is running on workernode1 that is a container ) 
   so we go inside that container and we can see the data in /mnt/data

1 What is Kubernetes and what does it do?
  It is a Open-Source Container Orchestration Tool 
		- Kubernetes is used to Deploy any type of Containers.
		- It is used to ensure high availability of the Applications/services running thru Containers.
		- Used to Ensure High Availability of Containers by creating Replicas of Containers.
		- It supports Auto-Scaling & Load Balancing.
		- Self-Healing

4 What are clusters in Kubernetes?
  A Kubernetes cluster is a collection of nodes (machines) that work together, with the control plane managing and 
  coordinating the worker nodes. 
  The cluster is responsible for running and managing applications in containers, 
  ensuring high availability, scalability, and reliability.

6 What is a node in Kubernetes?
   A node in Kubernetes is a machine (physical or virtual) that runs containerized applications. 
  There are two types of nodes: Master nodes that manage the cluster, and Worker nodes that run the applications.

7 List the main components of Kubernetes architecture.
 The Kubernetes architecture consists of two main parts:
  Control Plane: Manages the cluster and makes global decisions (API Server, Scheduler, Controller Manager, etcd).
  Node (Worker Node): Runs containers and workloads (Kubelet, Container Runtime, Kube Proxy, Pods).

            API_Server 				--> # Acts as an interface to the kubernetes or we can say it is the brain + entry gate of the Kubernetes cluster.
            ETCD 				--> # Single point of Source for Kubernetes Components or we can say it is a data source for the cluster
	        Controller Manager 	         	--> # To run the pods in its desired state 
            Scheduler				--> # To identify the Healthy Node for Deployments
	        Kubelet 				--> # Is a Kubernetes Agent used to Create & Deploy the Pods	
	        CRI - Container RunTime Interface (Container-D) --> # It is used identify the Image from Container Registry for deployment
            KubeProxy				--> # it enable communication between pods and services, inside and outside the cluster.
                                             Pod IPs are assigned by the CNI plugin (like Flannel, Calico, Weave)
You run: kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml
kubectl sends request → API Server
API Server validates YAML
Saves state in etcd
Scheduler gets notified
Scheduler selects a node
Kubelet on that node creates the pod

API Server stores state → Controller Manager checks → Scheduler assigns → Kubelet runs → Kube-Proxy connects → Repeat forever.

8 List the different types of services in Kubernetes.
  ClusterIP: The ClusterIP service is used to expose a service only within the Kubernetes cluster, not to the outside world.
             Backend Pod needs to talk to Database Pod
             Frontend Pod needs to talk to Backend Pod
             Microservices communicate internally

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    name: MyApp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9376
  type: ClusterIP

a ClusterIP service cannot be accessed directly from a browser; you must use "kubectl port-forward" (or another in-cluster access method).
kubectl port-forward svc/my-service 8080:80

  NodePort: Exposes your service outside the cluster by opening a port on every node.
            For testing
            When you don’t have a cloud LoadBalancer
            Small environments or labs
            Not good for production because:
               Port range is limited (30000–32767)
               No automatic load balancing
               Must enter IP + NodePort manually
  LoadBalancer: Provisions an external load balancer, exposing the service to the internet.
             You want public access
             Want automatic load balancing across nodes
            Not ideal when: 
            You create many services → each gets a public IP (costly)
            You want routing on paths/domains → not supported
  ExternalName: it is used to connect with external resource like database API
Ingress (Domain + routing + rules)
📌 What it does:
Ingress gives:
Domain name support
URL path routing
TLS/HTTPS
Single public IP for many services

Q To see all the resource pod/deployment/service
kubectl get all -n <namespace>

9 What is Ingress network?
  ingress is a traffic controler in lkubernetes which is used to send the traffic or route the traffice to the right service in kubernetes cluster
  Ingress helps direct incoming internet traffic to the right service inside the cluster. For example, if someone visits example.com/api, 
  Ingress will send that request to your "API" service, and if they visit example.com/blog, Ingress will send it to the "Blog" service

  Single Entry Point:
  Instead of creating a separate entry for each service (like exposing each one with its own IP address), 
  you can use Ingress to create one entry point (one IP or domain) that handles traffic for all your services. This simplifies the setup.
  Ingress is like a traffic controller that makes sure the right visitors (users) get directed to the right service in your Kubernetes cluster.
  It helps you manage access through one main entry point (a single IP or domain).
  It can handle things like routing, load balancing, and security (SSL encryption).

firstly we need to Install an Ingress Controller
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/main/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml

verify
kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx

after that we need to Create the different Services in this namespace (nginx) for that we need to create deployment in same namespace(nginx) first and after that create 
service for that deployment in same namespace(nginx)    we can create multiple svc like for mobile,clothes,accessories, all so on and all that services run in same namspace


apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: minimal-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx-example
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /mobile
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: mobile
            port:
              number: 80
      - path: /clothes
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: clothes
            port:
              number: 8080

after that we need to expose or forward the ingress controller svc
kubectl port-forward svc/ingress-nginx-controller -n ingress-nginx 8080:80

so now wwe can add multiple services in ingress  it is called microservices

Deleting a namespace deletes all workloads and networking objects inside it, immediately making the application inaccessible.
Yes, a single kubectl delete namespace can shut down everything, unless you put safeguards in place. Here’s how this is prevented in real-world clusters.

kubectl auth can-i delete namespaces --all-namespaces

30 How do you set resource limits on Kubernetes Pods?
   we can limit flag in yaml file to limit the resource on pods  like cpu and memory usage 
   or we can also request for memory and cpu 

  Memory Limits: If a container exceeds its memory limit, it will be terminated and potentially restarted by Kubernetes.
  This is called an OOM (Out of Memory) Kill.
  CPU Limits: When a container exceeds its CPU limit, it will be throttled (i.e., Kubernetes will restrict the container's 
  CPU usage but will not kill it).

resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "500m"        # Guaranteed CPU
    memory: "1Gi"      # Guaranteed memory
  limits:
    cpu: "1"           # Max CPU allowed
    memory: "2Gi"      # Max memory allowed

containers:
- name: mysql
  image: mysql:8.0
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: "500m"
      memory: "1Gi"
    limits:
      cpu: "1"
      memory: "2Gi"

What are Probes in Kubernetes?
Probes tell Kubernetes when to start traffic, restart containers, and check health of your application.
They are critical for production workloads.
🔹 Types of Probes (VERY IMPORTANT)
1️⃣ Liveness Probe
👉 Is the container alive?
If it fails → container is restarted
Used to recover from deadlocks

2️⃣ Readiness Probe
👉 Is the container ready to receive traffic?
If it fails → traffic is stopped
Pod is NOT restarted

3️⃣ Startup Probe
👉 Is the app finished starting up?
Disables liveness until startup completes
Prevents premature restarts

🧠 Real-world behavior
Probe	Fails →
Liveness	Container restart
Readiness	Traffic removed
Startup	Startup still in progress
🔧 Probe methods
exec (run command inside container)
httpGet
tcpSocket

exec Probe
An exec probe is used to check application health by running a command inside the container
What it’s used for (real-world)
Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis)

livenessProbe:
  exec:
    command:
    - sh
    - -c
    - mysqladmin ping -h 127.0.0.1 -u root -p$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
  initialDelaySeconds: 60
  periodSeconds: 10
  timeoutSeconds: 5
  failureThreshold: 3

readinessProbe:
  exec:
    command:
    - sh
    - -c
    - mysqladmin ping -h 127.0.0.1 -u root -p$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  periodSeconds: 5
  timeoutSeconds: 3
  failureThreshold: 3

startupProbe:
  exec:
    command:
    - sh
    - -c
    - mysqladmin ping -h 127.0.0.1 -u root -p$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
  failureThreshold: 30
  periodSeconds: 10

httpGet Probe 
An HTTP probe checks application health by sending an HTTP request to a container endpoint.
Where HTTP probes are used
✅ Web apps (Nginx, Spring Boot, Node.js)
❌ Databases (MySQL, Redis)

livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /
    port: 80
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 10

readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /
    port: 80
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 5

startupProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8080
  failureThreshold: 30
  periodSeconds: 10

31 Explain Kubernetes taints and tolerations.
  Taints and Tolerations are a way to control where pods can run in a Kubernetes cluster.
taints- like we can taints a nodes(worker-node) so if we taints a node than pod can not run on that node
kubectl taint nodes node1 role=db:NoSchedule
kubectl taint nodes node1 role=db:NoSchedule-               # '-' it used to untained means now pod can run on this pod

tolerance- but if we still want to run the pod on taints node for that we use tolerance.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mysql-pod
spec:
  tolerations:
  - key: "role"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "db"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
  containers:
  - name: mysql
    image: mysql:8.0

so now pod can still run node1     # or we can say we can run the pod on taints node using tolerations in menifest file

Q  k8s Metrics
Metrics Server scrapes resource metrics from the kubelets running on each node and provides them in a central API endpoint (/apis/metrics.k8s.io/).
CPU usage (millicores)
Memory usage (bytes)

so firstly we need to install metrics server 
1st run this
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml

2nd
kubectl -n kube-system edit deployment metrics-server                # this will open a file so edit that file 
Add these args under containers.args:
- --kubelet-insecure-tls
- --kubelet-preferred-address-types=InternalIP,ExternalIP,Hostname

3rd
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep metrics-server
kubectl top nodes
output-
NAME	CPU(cores)	CPU%	MEMORY(bytes)	MEMORY%
node1	  120m	     6%	       1024Mi	      25%

Node Affinity
Node affinity is a Kubernetes feature that lets you control which nodes a Pod is allowed or preferred to run on, based on labels on nodes.
Run this Pod only (or preferably) on nodes that match certain conditions.”
Node affinity lets you tell Kubernetes where Pods should (or must) run based on node labels.

RBAC (Role Base Access Control)
RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) in Kubernetes controls who can do what on which resources in the cluster.
Think of it like this:
WHO (user/service account)
CAN DO WHAT (verbs like get, create, delete)
ON WHICH RESOURCES (pods, services, deployments)
IN WHICH SCOPE (namespace or cluster)

Namespace-level RBAC (MOST COMMON)
firstly we need to create the role
then we need to create ServiceAccount 
then we need to binding role to serviceAccount 
then add to pod/deployment
Role → ServiceAccount → RoleBinding → Pod                      #Users are for humans.
                                                                ServiceAccounts are for applications (bots, pods).
role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: pod-reader
  namespace: dev
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]

service aacount
kubectl create serviceaccount app-sa -n dev

Role Binding 
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: pod-reader-binding
  namespace: dev
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: app-sa
  namespace: dev
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io

pod
spec:
  serviceAccountName: app-sa

Cluster-level RBAC (IN-CLUSTER / GLOBAL ACCESS)
ClusterRole → ServiceAccount → ClusterRoleBinding → Pod

using Cluster role we can create dashbaords
Dashboards are created to provide a visual, centralized view of a system so humans can monitor, understand, and manage it easily.
Dashboards exist to help humans see and manage what’s happening inside the cluster without using only CLI commands.
ClusterRole is used for controllers, operators, monitoring, networking, and any component that needs cluster-wide or node-level access, not just dashboards.”

CPU usage 🧠
Memory usage 💾
Pod status (Running / CrashLoopBackOff)
Node health
Network usage

Most used monitoring tools
1️⃣ Prometheus (MOST POPULAR)
Collects metrics from:
Nodes
Pods
Services
Stores time-based data
💡 Think of Prometheus as a data collector

2️⃣ Grafana
Shows metrics as graphs and dashboards
Uses Prometheus data
💡 Think of Grafana as a TV screen for metrics
Example (real)
If CPU goes above 80% → alert is sent 🚨

Logging 
kubectl get pods
kubectl log pod-name
kubectl describe pod pod-name

to seee the previous crash logs
kubectl logs pod-name --previous

If pod has multiple containers
kubectl logs pod-name -c container

Helm                        # to download the helm we can go for official documentation
Helm simplifies deploying and managing apps in Kubernetes by packaging all resources together.

Helm lets you install, upgrade, and delete apps with one command
Helm is like a package manager for Kubernetes.
Just like npm installs JavaScript packages Or pip installs Python packages
Helm installs apps on Kubernetes in a structured way.

to create helm
helm create helm-name (apache-helm) 

. Install Helm
helm version   # check
brew install helm   # Mac

2. Create a Chart
helm create myapp 

3. Configure Values
Edit values.yaml for image, replicas, service type, etc.

4. Update Templates (Optional)
Edit files in templates/ if needed (e.g., deployment.yaml).

5. Install the Chart
helm install myapp-dev/prod/staging ./myapp
helm install myapp-dev/prod/staging ./myapp -n dev/prod/staging --create-namespace

Increase Number of Replicas
Edit values.yaml (or environment-specific values file):
replicaCount: 4
helm upgrade myapp-dev ./myapp -n dev -f values-dev.yaml

Use --set directly in command
helm upgrade myapp-dev ./myapp -n dev --set replicaCount=4

Rollback a Release
If an upgrade causes problems, you can rollback to a previous release version.
List revision history:
helm history myapp-dev -n dev
Shows revision numbers and timestamps.

helm rollback myapp-dev <revision-number> -n dev
helm rollback myapp-dev 2 -n dev

6. Upgrade Chart
helm upgrade myapp-dev/prod/staging ./myapp -n dev/prod/staginge

7. Uninstall Chart
helm uninstall myapp-dev/prod/staging -n dev/prod/staging

8. Package Chart (Optional)
helm package myapp

myapp/
  Chart.yaml          # Chart metadata   #This file contains basic information about your Helm chart, like its name, version, and description. It’s required for every chart.
  values.yaml         # Default configuration values #replicaCount → Number of pods, image.repository → Docker image name, image.tag → Version, service.type → clusterip,NodePort
  charts/             # Subcharts (dependencies)
  templates/          # Kubernetes manifest templates
  .helmignore         # Files to ignore in packaging

A Spring Boot app on Kubernetes mainly uses Deployment, Service, Ingress, ConfigMap, Secret, HPA, and Monitoring resources, all managed easily using Helm.

If a required Kubernetes resource is not present in the Helm chart, we add a new template YAML file under templates/, parameterize it using values.yaml, and deploy
it using helm upgrade.

Why Do We Use Helm Repositories?
We use Helm repositories to store, version, share, and reuse Helm charts so applications can be installed consistently across environments.

helm install myapp ./myapp
👉 Only works if the chart exists locally.

Benefits of Using Helm Repo
Package Chart (Optional)
helm package myapp

1️⃣ Centralized Storage
Charts stored in one central place
Everyone installs from the same source
Example:
helm install myapp myrepo/myapp

2️⃣ Version Control
Each chart has versions:
myapp-1.0.0.tgz
myapp-1.1.0.tgz

Allows:
Easy upgrades
Safe rollbacks

3️⃣ Easy Sharing Across Teams
Dev, QA, Prod teams use the same chart
No need to copy files manually

Create Helm chart in repo
Customize templates
Git version control & tag
Package chart
Publish to Helm/OCI repo
Install with helm install elsewhere

for git
if we use git for version controle we can push to git and whenever we need for reuse we can git clone and got to dir and install helm

for dockerhub
helm registry login registry-1.docker.io
helm package myapp
myapp-0.1.0.tgz
helm push myapp-0.1.0.tgz oci://registry-1.docker.io/<dockerhub-username>
helm install insureme \
  oci://registry-1.docker.io/mukunddeotale49/myapp \
  --version 0.1.0 \
  -n prod --create-namespace

OCI = Open Container Initiative

helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm install monitoring prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack -n monitoring --create-namespace

helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm install grafana grafana/grafana -n monitoring --create-namespace

kubectl port-forward svc/monitoring-grafana 3000:80 -n monitoring
Login  and add data source in grafana as prometheus

Init Container
Definition: A container that runs before the main container starts in a Pod.
Purpose: Perform setup tasks that must finish before the main app runs.
Example Use Cases
Initialize a database schema
Download config files
Wait for another service to be ready

Sidecar Container
Definition: A container that runs alongside the main container in the same Pod.
Purpose: Add auxiliary functionality like logging, monitoring, or proxying.
Example Use Cases
Push logs to ELK/Fluentd

what is service mesh 
A service mesh is an infrastructure layer that helps manage communication between microservices in a distributed application.

for service mesh we need a tool to do this (istio, linkerd)
For Kind
# Install Istio CLI
For Kubeadm
# Install Istio CLI

Istio is a traffic manager for microservices

Kubernetes runs containers: Kubernetes starts and keeps your app containers alive (example: runs frontend and backend pods).
Istio controls traffic: Istio decides how services talk to each other (example: send 90% traffic to backend v1 and 10% to v2).
Envoy enforces rules: Envoy proxies actually apply those decisions to requests (example: retry a failed request or block unauthorized calls).
Control plane manages Envoy: Istio control plane configures all Envoy proxies centrally (example: push new routing rules without redeploying apps).
Kiali visualizes everything: Kiali shows a live graph of services and traffic health (example: see frontend → backend → payment with errors and latency)

15 What do you know about clusters of containers in Kubernetes? 
  A Kubernetes Cluster consists of a control plane (master) and multiple worker nodes.
  Each node runs a container runtime (e.g., Docker, containerd) that runs Pods.
  Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, and they can contain one or more containers.
  Kubernetes clusters provide features like scaling, self-healing, and load balancing for containerized applications, making them ideal for running large-scale distributed systems.

32 How does a Kubernetes Network Policy work?
  A Kubernetes Network Policy is a way to control the communication (traffic) between pods in a Kubernetes cluster. 
  like which pod can comuunicate with each other 
  We want to make sure the frontend pod can talk to the backend pod, but no other pods can talk to the backend pod.

37. its ok if I had 2 container in one pod , what you will suggest
   it’s okay to have two containers in one Pod, especially when they need to work together closely 
   However, always evaluate if they really need to be in the same Pod, as separating them can improve flexibility 
   and scalability.
   Can reduce scalability because both containers scale together. If one container needs more resources or scaling,
   both containers will scale together.

  Create a Service to expose the app.
  Verify with kubectl get.
  Access the app through the Service (LoadBalancer/NodePort).

41. After deletion of pod data get deleted , how to retain pod data
   To retain data after Pod deletion, use Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs):
   Create a Persistent Volume (PV) to define storage.
   Create a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) to request storage.
   Mount PVC in the Pod to retain data.
