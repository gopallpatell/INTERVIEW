Q how internet works?
The Internet works by sending a request from the user (client) to a server where the data is stored. DNS converts the website name into an IP address, and using that IP 
address the request reaches the server. then The server responds by serving the requested data back to the client.” 
Ex.-
google.com->ISP->DNS->Server

Q what is a server ?
 A server is a computer or system that provides services, data, or resources to other computers (called clients) over a network or the internet.

Q what is the diff between Server & Client 
Client is used to request data (files, images, services), and the server serves that data to the client.

Q what is the difference between web server and application server ?
A web server serves static content, while an application server is where the application runs and processes business logic.
Web Server → HTML, CSS, JS, images (static files)
Application Server → Runs code, connects to database, generates dynamic data

Web server delivers files, application server runs the application logic.

Q types of Applications
 there are mainly two types of application 
Standalone Application: Runs on a single system without internet, e.g., Calculator, MS word.
Web Application: Runs on a web browser and requires a server/network/database, e.g., Gmail, Facebook.

Q why Linux used widely 
Linux is widely used because it’s free, secure, stable, fast, and ideal for servers and networking.

Q components of Linux?
Kernel – Core of Linux, manages CPU, memory, and hardware.
Shell – Interface between user and kernel (command-line).
File System – Organizes files and directories.
Libraries – Pre-written code for programs to use.  
Utilities / Commands – Programs for tasks like copying, moving, or editing files.
Bootloader - Bootloader is the first program that starts the OS when a computer powers on.  GRUB, LILO
Bootloader runs first because it’s the “starter program” that loads the OS into the computer.


Q Stats of processes?
  running
  sleeping
  Stopped 
  killed
  terminating
  Zombie

Q to remove directory/folder
  rm -r cloud/
  rmdir cloud/

Q to print the first and last line from a file 
  first - head -n 5 file1
  last  - tail -n 5 file1 
  tail -f file1 - it will monitor the file which is  continuously updating like logs file so it will go inside the file and show us the continuously updating new lines.

Q 'less' and 'more' command 
   both are commands are used to see the file page by page like if we have a log.txt file with 200 pages and we want to see the file page by page then we use less and more 
   command 
more /var/log/log.txt
Press Space → next page
Press Enter → next line
Press q → quit

less /var/log/log.txt
Press Space → next page
Press b → previous page
Press ↑ / ↓ → move line by line
Press /error → search word
Press q → quit

more moves only forward, while less allows both forward and backward navigation.

Q 'cp' command 
 cp file1.txt devops/
 cp cloud/file1.txt devops/
 cp -r cloud/ devops/  #-r - recursively cp folder
 
Q 'mv' - to move and rename the file 
 mv file.txt devOps/     # to move the file forward
 mv file.txt ../cloud/   # to move the file backward .. is for backward directory
 mv devops/ Linux_for_devops  # rename
 mv file.txt file1..txt

Q 'wc'  
to see how many lines, words, and byte present in a file
wc file.txt   # it will work with multiple file in same command

Q what is hard link and soft link 
   Both hard link and soft link are used to link files. In a soft link, if the original file is deleted, the link breaks. But in a hard link, the file still exists even if 
   the original file is deleted.
ln -s file.txt softlink.txt     ln -s cloud/devops/file.txt softlink.txt
ln file.txt hardlink.txt        ln cloud/devops/file.txt hardlink.txt

ln → Hard link → data still accessible
ln -s → Soft link → breaks the link if original file is deleted and we cant access the data.

Q 'cut'
 cut is used to give some portion or byte 
 cut 1 file..txt       # hello dosto   is the file content
 output - h
 cut 1-4 file.txt
 output - hello

Q 'tee'
tee command is used to create a file with content
echo "hello" | tee file.txt

Q 'sort'
it is used to rearrange the words and latter in alphabetical manner..

Q 'diff'
 this command is used to see the deference between two files or dir.
diff file.txt file1.txt 


Q nohup?
it is used to save the output of anything in the file that is "nohup.out"
like if we want to save the logs of any file into a file then we can use nohup <command>
 nohup top   nohup free -h   nohup df   nohup du 

Q 'uname'  is used to se the operator/plateform  like linux/darwin(mac)

Q 'uptime'  used to see how long system has being running along with load and user..

Q diff in 'who' and whoami"
 "who" is used to see hoe many users loggin in this user, time when a user login to this system.
 "whoami" is used to see who is the current loged in user. 

Q 'which' 
  this command is used to see the current path and current version of anything. like we can see where the tool is installed in which folder/dir.
  which java    which python  which docker   

Q Package Management - Package Managers :::
				- Package Managers are used to install/Uninstall/Upgrade the Packages/software 
			
					- Centos / RHEL 		===> 	yum package Manager 
					- Debian / Ubuntu 		===>	apt/apt-get package Manager 
					- Fedora				===>	dnf (Latest Version of Fedora)
													yum (Previous Version of Fedora)

Q 'ctrl + r' it is used to search the command in cli 
  using this we can search the previously used commands         # to remove any tool -- sudo apt remove docker.io 
                                                    
Q to create and delete a user 
sudo useradd -m adminuser
sudo userdel adminuser

Q to create Group 
sudo groupadd devops      # it will create devops group
usermod -aG <group_name> <user_name
usermod -aG docker devopsadmin

Q 'chmod' is used to change the permissions of files

Q What is umask in Linux?
It decides which permissions should NOT be given when a new file or directory is created.
File default = 666 → rw-rw-rw-
Directory default = 777 → rwxrwxrwx

in linux umask is 0002    so permission is rwxrwxr-x
how to change the umask
Temporary       	umask 027
Permanent (user)	~/.bashrc     vi ~/.bashrc -> add at the end umask 027 -> source ~/.bashrc

Q "chown" It is used to change the owner and group of a file or directory.
chown [OPTIONS] owner:group file_name
for only user
chown user1 file.txt
                          only group
                          chown :devops file.txt
user and group
chown user1:devops file.txt
                           Change ownership recursively (directory + files)
                            chown -R user1:devops /project or file(file.txt)

           
Q What is zip?                                     # other tools gunzip,gzip

unzip
unzip file.zip

-e Password protect zip
zip -e secure.zip file.txt

Check zip contents (without extracting)
unzip -l file.zip

Q what is LVM(logical volume manager)
Physical Volume (PV) → Each EBS volume you attach to the EC2 instance is treated as a physical volume in LVM.
sudo pvcreate /dev/xvdf
sudo pvdisplay

Volume Group (VG) → Multiple PVs can be combined into a volume group, which acts like a storage pool. This allows you to 
manage multiple disks as a single unit.
sudo vgcreate vg_data /dev/xvdf
sudo vgdisplay

Logical Volume (LV) → From the volume group, you create logical volumes, which behave like normal partitions. You format them
with a filesystem and mount them for use.
sudo lvcreate -L 10G -n lv_data vg_data
sudo lvdisplay

EBS Volume → PV → combine PVs → VG → create LV → format & mount → usable storage

Create Filesystem on LV
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg_data/lv_data

mount
sudo mkdir /data
sudo mount /dev/vg_data/lv_data /data







Q2. How do you mount and unmount filesystems in Linux?
  mount is used to attach a storage device (like a hard drive, USB drive, or disk image) to a specific directory (mount point) in the filesystem.
