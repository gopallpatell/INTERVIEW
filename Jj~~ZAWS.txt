servers, known as instances, in the cloud.

1 diff between authorization and authentication.
       Authentication
       Purpose: Verifies who the user is.
       means the person who is looking for the access, he needs authentication using username password and other things.
       Authorization:
       Purpose: Determines what the user is allowed to do.
       means who gives the access or allowed to do anything.

2 what is IAM..?
      IAM (Identity and Access Management) 
      In short, IAM ensures that the right people have the right access to the right resources.

3. Instance type in AWS.
      In AWS, an instance type defines the hardware specifications (such as CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity) 
      of a virtual server (called an EC2 instance) that you can launch in the cloud.
      Choosing the right instance type depends on:
      Workload: Whether it's CPU, memory, or storage-intensive.
      Cost: Some instance types are more expensive based on their specifications.
      Performance: Choose an instance that matches your performance requirements for a given application.

4.  Different way to connect with ec2.

    How to use:
    Ensure you have the private key (.pem file) associated with the EC2 instance.
    Open a terminal or command prompt.
    2. EC2 Instance Connect (Browser-based SSH for Linux)
    3. Third-Party Tools (e.g., PuTTY, MobaXterm for SSH)

A Load Balancer is a service that automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers 
or resources to ensure high availability, reliability, and optimal performance of your application
Application Load Balancer (ALB):
Sends web traffic to the right server based on the URL (like sending image requests to one server and API requests to another).

Network Load Balancer (NLB):
Sends fast traffic (like games or streaming) to the right server.

Classic Load Balancer (CLB):

AMI An AMI is a pre-configured image based on existing image we use ami for a reapititive task like if we want to use all the configuration of a instance in future for that
we can create the AMI based on that instance,
SNAPSHOT it is used for the backup up EBS volume of the instance the EBS volume of the instance we can take manually or we can take on a perticulor time for that we use
 lifecycle policy for the taking the snapshot daily.

   - The DELETE statement is used to remove records from a table.
   - The CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table in a database.
   - The DROP TABLE statement is used to delete a table and all its data.
   - The JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column.
Oracle- Oracle Database is a powerful system used to store and manage large amounts of data.
             Oracle is often used in large businesses because it ensures data is safe, organized, and easily accessible.

16. what is cloudformation and stack in cloudformation.
it is used to provisioning the AWS resources, we can provisioning only AWS resources using cloudFormation.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Define your infrastructure in code, which can be version-controlled and reused.
Automated Provisioning: Automatically creates, updates, and deletes AWS resources based on your templates.

stack in cloudformation
   A CloudFormation Stack is essentially a collection of AWS resources
   if you have a CloudFormation template that defines an EC2 instance, an S3 bucket, and a security group, these resources will be grouped into a stack. 
   If you need to make changes to the resources (e.g., update an EC2 instance type or add a new S3 bucket), you can modify the template and update the entire stack.
 Resources:
  MyEC2Instance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:

37 How does AWS Route 53 work?
  Amazon Route 53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) service that routes traffic by translating 
  human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other. 
  Additionally, Route 53 supports domain name registration, allowing you to purchase and manage domain names directly 
  within AWS."

38. Explain AWS CloudFormation and how it differs from Terraform.
  Using AWS CloudFormation, you can only provision and manage AWS resources, as it is specifically designed for the AWS 
  ecosystem. On the other hand, Terraform is a multi-cloud tool that allows you to provision resources across various cloud 
  platforms, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and more."

39. What is AWS Fargate, and how does it work?
   it is a serverless compute engine it can be integrate by both services ECS EKS 
   it is used to run containers (e.g., Docker containers) without managing the underlying servers or infrastructure.
When you deploy the application on ECS or EKS using Fargate, AWS handles the provisioning of the underlying infrastructure 
 (such as EC2 instances) automatically.
You only need to specify the CPU and memory requirements for the containers in your task definition or pod specification. 
 Fargate takes care of everything else, including scaling and load balancing.

40 what services will give you high availability, fault tolarance, scalability in aws
Amazon CloudFront
High Availability: CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) that caches content at edge locations globally, ensuring 
 fast and reliable content delivery.
Fault Tolerance: CloudFront automatically routes traffic to the nearest healthy edge location in case one fails.
Scalability: CloudFront scales automatically to accommodate large numbers of concurrent users and high data traffic.

auto scalling 
High Availability: Auto Scaling automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in a scaling group, ensuring that your 
 application has enough resources to handle traffic and is highly available.
Fault Tolerance: Auto Scaling can replace unhealthy instances and launch new instances to maintain desired capacity, 
 ensuring that the application stays fault-tolerant.
Scalability: Auto Scaling scales up or down based on load (CPU, network traffic, etc.), ensuring the application can handle 
 changes in demand without manual intervention.

 Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
High Availability: ELB distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets (EC2 instances, containers, etc.) across different AZs, improving availability.
Fault Tolerance: ELB automatically detects unhealthy instances and reroutes traffic to healthy instances, ensuring continuous service even if one instance fails.
Scalability: ELB automatically adjusts to the incoming traffic load and distributes it accordingly to ensure balanced performance.

 Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
High Availability: Amazon S3 is designed to be highly available across multiple geographic regions. It automatically replicates data across multiple AZs within a region.
Fault Tolerance: S3 automatically handles data replication and can recover from failures, ensuring that your data is durable and available even if part of the system fails.
Scalability: S3 scales automatically to accommodate large amounts of data without any manual intervention, offering virtually unlimited storage.
