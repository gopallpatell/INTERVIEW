Q1 What do you mean by Maven?
  maven is opensource tool used to compile the the code and create the artifacts.

Q2 What are the features or advantages of Maven?

it will automatically download and manage the dependencies defined in pom.xml.it is free and open source.

   Manages Dependencies: Automatically downloads and manages libraries for your project.
Automates Builds: Compiles code, runs tests, and packages the project with a single command.
Standard Structure: Provides a consistent folder and project layout.
Uses Plugins: Extends functionality for tasks like testing, deployment, and analysis.
Lifecycle Management: Runs tasks (e.g., compile, test, package) in the correct order.
Less Configuration: Uses defaults to reduce manual setup.
Handles Multi-Module Projects: Manages large projects split into smaller parts.
Integrates Easily: Works with Jenkins, IDEs, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines.
Free and Open Source: No cost, with strong community support.

Q3 What is meant by Maven build lifecycle? Name these cycles.
   it is a set of steps or phases to complete tasks like compiling code, running tests, and packaging the project.
Default Lifecycle: Handles the core tasks of building and deploying a project.
Clean Lifecycle: Cleans the project by removing old build files.
Site Lifecycle: Creates project documentation.

Default Lifecycle: Manages core build tasks like:

validate: Check project readiness.
compile: Compile code.
test: Run tests.
package: Create JAR/WAR.
install: Add to local repository.
deploy: Publish to a remote repository.

Clean Lifecycle: Cleans the project:
clean: Removes old build files.

Site Lifecycle: Generates project documentation:
site: Creates and publishes docs.

Q4  What do you mean by POM and what does it contain?

It is used to define the properties of application artifacts 
				- It is used to define dependencies and the plugins required to perform build/unit-testing

Q5   What do you mean by a Maven Repository?

Maven Repositories Contains the Maven Dependencies and Plugins 

Q6  Explain Maven Artifact.

artifacts are the output of the maven build. artifacts are the binarys converted from high lavel language to system understable language.

Q7 List down the various scopes of Maven Dependency.

Maven scopes control when and how dependencies are used    

Maven Scope determines when a dependency is available in your project:

compile: Always available (default).
provided: Available at compile/runtime but not in the final artifact.
runtime: Available only at runtime.
test: Available only for tests.
system: Uses a local file path for the dependency.
import

Q8  What are the differences between Maven and Ant?

Maven and Ant are tools for building projects:

Maven:

Simplifies project management with conventions.
Manages dependencies and build lifecycle automatically.
Easier to use and more modern.
Ant:

Requires custom build scripts.
Manages dependencies manually.
More flexible but more complex to set up.

Q9 What do you mean by Maven Archetype?

it is a plugin
Maven Archetype is a template for creating a new Maven project with a predefined structure and configuration. 
It helps quickly set up projects with a standard setup, such as project structure, dependencies, and build configurations.

Q10 What is known as SNAPSHOT in Maven?

SNAPSHOT is a version used for packages that are continuously updated:


Q11  What does goal in Maven mean? 

a goal is a specific task in Maven,

Maven Goals : 
				This defines the actions we perform using Maven 

				● mvn compile 	- to compile the source code
				● mvn test 		- to compile and execute junit test cases
				● mvn package 	- to compile, test and create artifacts in the target folder of Project Library
				● mvn clean 	- to clean the target folder.

Q12  Name the build phases in Maven Build Lifecycle.

Validate: Checks that the project is correct and all required information is available.
Compile: Compiles the source code of the project.
Test: Runs unit tests to ensure the code behaves as expected.
Package: Packages the compiled code into a distributable format (e.g., JAR, WAR).
Install: Installs the packaged artifact into the local repository for future use.
Deploy: Deploys the packaged artifact to a remote repository (e.g., Maven Central).
